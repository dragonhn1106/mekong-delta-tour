                  <p>Mekong Delta is very potential in tourism which is original and different form all other regions of the country. The delta has a pleasant tropical monsoonal climate with two alternate seasons: dry and rainy. Dry season runs from November through April/May with average temperature around 28 °C and the rainy season from May to October.</p>

                  <img src="/common/images/blog/detail/post_img01.jpg" alt="Mekong Delta is blessed with pleasant weather and peaceful landscape.">
                  <figcaption>Mekong Delta is blessed with pleasant weather and peaceful landscape.</figcaption>

                <div class="inner-pd">
                  <p>Mekong Delta gets plenty of rain and hot, humid weather during the southwest monsoon from April to September, with June and July being especially wet. The southwest monsoon brings most heavy rains from May through October, giving additive effects on Mekong high flows, thus causing floods at various depths in scattered areas. However, there is no problem to visit the Mekong Delta in the rainy season – typically the rain lasts for about an hour.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of the rain season, mostly in April, May and June, has a comfortable climate with light rain and warm weather so that the visitors can have a good time exploring the river areas and fruit gardens. Furthermore, travelers may be interested in festivals which occur in Can Tho around this time such as the Cholchonam Thomay (New Year) Festival and the Opening Crop Festival.</p>
                  <p>From June to September, it may be hot and humid but the greatest variety of tropical fruit is available only in these months.</p>
                  <p>During October and November, occasional flooding is expected, especially in remote areas around Dong Thap and Tra Vinh, so stay informed of regional weather forecast ahead of your trip if you are travelling in these months. Flood season, also known as the floating season, often last from August/September to November. Inhabitants of the Mekong Delta region don’t consider flooding as natural disaster. The flood, however, sweeps everything away and brings a new face to the delta with its rich brown alluvial water. This is also the income season for local people with abundant fish and water vegetables. Farmers engage themselves in fishing either for home consumption or as an 'off-season' business. The waterfront life is most fascinating in this season. During the floating season in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, wild water lilies grow everywhere in rice fields covered by water. Even though the weather at this time is not necessarily perfect, you have the advantage of more favorable prices and significantly fewer tourists.</p>
                  <p>Given its seasonal flooding, the Mekong Delta reveals its best during dry months from December to May when the sky is crystal clear, the land is lush and the water is calm.</p>
                  <p>To sum up, Mekong Delta can be visited all year round with fruits in the four seasons and fresh environment. It is most vibrant in spring (flower season: late January - March) and early summer (fruit season: April - May), the best time to visit Mekong Delta, also the best time to visit Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam in general.</p>
